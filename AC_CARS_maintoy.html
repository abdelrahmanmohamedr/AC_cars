                    Last on our list but certainly, not least is the 2019 Toyota GR Supra. This vehicle has a history in Japanese car culture and is comparable to 
                    the Honda NSX and Nissan GT-R according to Top Gear. Being the owner of a 2019 Toyota GR Supra could very well be on your wish list since the design of the cockpit is high-end.
                 <br> <br>
                 If you are the type of driver that likes to have a need for speed then the Supra is a must-have. The added feature of putting this car in sport driving mode livens up the ride 
                 and acceleration.

                <p class="overviewp">
                    While most of Toyota's lineup consists of consumer-grade sedans and SUVs, models marked with the initials GR represent the automaker's highest levels of performance, and chief
                     among that subset is the 2024 GR Supra. While it's based on—and built alongside—the BMW Z4 convertible, the Supra brings an entirely different curb appeal. The two share most 
                     everything else though, including 255-hp turbocharged four-cylinder and 382-hp turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engines. All Supra models are rear-wheel drive and you can 
                     have either an eight-speed automatic or, as we prefer, a six-speed manual. The interior borrows heavily from the BMW parts bin—either a good or bad thing depending on who you 
                     ask. But it comes with few compromises and there's plenty of space for two adults to get comfortable even on long drives. The Supra's sharp handling and responsive powertrains, 
                     however, mean its happier nipping apexes than long highway slogs.

                </h2>

                    Before 2023, all Supra models came with an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive; last year, a six-speed manual finally became available, but only with the 
                    optional turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six. At the test track, our long-term 2020 GR Supra 3.0 (with the eight-speed automatic) laid down some seriously impressive acceleration 
                    numbers, hitting 60 mph in 3.7 seconds and 100 mph in 9.5 ticks. With the six-speed manual, those figures increase slightly to 3.9 and 9.6 seconds, respectively. That puts it 
                    in the big leagues against the Chevy Camaro SS, the Porsche Cayman GTS, and the BMW M2 Competition. In fact, it's even quicker than the vaunted fourth-generation Supra, which was
                     powered by a sequentially turbocharged inline-six with 320 horsepower. Despite its performance potential, the GR Supra's suspension is forgiving enough to drive daily. Its
                      steering is accurate, nicely weighted, and direct, which enhances its fun-to-drive personality. The lower-priced four-cylinder model delivered a brisk 4.7-second 60-mph run 
                      at our test track. That's quicker than the GR Supra's German cousin—the BMW Z4—which managed a 5.0-second 60-mph time. The one negative we found with the performance of our 
                      long-term GR Supra was the ease with which it got stuck in snow.

                <p class="Fuel_Economy_and_Real-World_MPGp">
                    The most efficient GR Supra is the one with the turbocharged four-cylinder engine, which earns EPA ratings of 25 mpg city and 32 highway. The more powerful GR Supra 3.0's
                     ratings are still pretty good at 23 mpg city and 31 highway for the automatic and 19 and 27 mpg for the 3.0 manual. That's more efficient than the Camaro, the Cayman GTS, 
                     and the M2. On our 75-mph highway fuel-economy test route, the six-cylinder GR Supra exceeded its highway rating by delivering 34 mpg; with the turbo four, the GR Supra 
                     delivered a stellar 38 mpg. For more information about the GR Supra's fuel economy,

                    The driver-focused cockpit is tight, and although the double-bubble roof provides some additional headroom, the tallest drivers will feel pinched. Cargo space is similarly
                    cramped, but the cargo area (accessed via a hatchback) is roomy enough for a couple of carry-on suitcases or about a week's worth of groceries for two. In our testing, we
                     managed to fit four carry-on suitcases behind the rear seats. The Toyota shares much of its interior with the Z4, so those familiar with BMW switchgear and infotainment 
                     controls will feel right at home.

                    Toyota offers a host of driver-assistance features as standard across the GR Supra lineup, including automated emergency braking. Additional features, such as adaptive cruise
                     control and blind-spot monitoring, can be added via the optional Driver's Assist package. For more information about the GR Supra's crash-test results, visit the National 
                     Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) websites. Key safety features include:
